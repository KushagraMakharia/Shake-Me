# Shake Me

Just as the name implies. Ok, there's a bit more...


The app plays a gif and a repeating sound clip in the background. This was initially made just for playing the Batman on Drugs video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1dvSlvZLG8) when the user shook the phone. Features were added to the app to allow the user to play any gif or mp4 they downloaded on their phone so it is no longer limited to just this gif and mp4.


## Device Permissions
I noticed recently that the app on the app store asks for access to photos/media/files and device id & call information. I am not doing anything with this data nor do I ask for it in the app. The only reason I have found that explains why the app on the app store asks for these permissions is this one I found on stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30277242/why-is-my-app-asking-for-phone-id-permission). The top answer points to text in the Manifest Merger documentation which states that newer android releases which target newer android sdk versions but use older sdk libraries ask for this information. On older releases, these permissions were not automatically granted. This app was developed and tested on an old android phone which targeted an old android sdk. I would fix this, but do not want to spend time to re-download and build the android sdk, this app, and re-upload it to the google play store.


## App Legitimacy?
I cannot believe I got emails about this. To anyone with any legitimate concern about the authenticity of this app: this is just a dump app that I made overnight early in college for funs. I'm not "hacking" anyone's' phones, paying people to write good reviews, or anything that should be taken seriously. This is not a serious app. This is just a joke I made to confuse users and entertain people for quick laughs. Not understanding how it works or the purpose of this is part of the joke.
